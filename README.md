# Ultrasound-Image-Challenge

This work was created as part of a [challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/cameroon-advance-analytic-ultrasound-image-challenge) on Zindi. The objective of the challenge is to build a machine learning model that can predict if kidneys are in renal failure from ultrasounds and to build a hub of data scientists and analysts in Cameroon.
